## Pancake Sort

I took a look at [this](http://austingwalters.com/everyday-algorithms-pancake-sort/) blog post that was
discovered via Reddit and decided to put something together to solve this. I am
going to iterate on this as the current implementation is pretty rough, and slow. I'd also
like to add in the portion about having all of the burnt sides facing down. That will
come later.
